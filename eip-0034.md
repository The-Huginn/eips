# NFT Collection Standard V1

* Author: anon_real
* Status: Proposed
* Created: 10-May-2022

* Forking: not needed 

## Motivation 
NFT collections play a central role in the nowadays NFT ecosystem on all blockchains. It gives the ability to artists to organize their artworks and present them in a more meaningful way. It also can facilitate the use of other NFT features such as traits. As we'll present in this proposal, it can also enable more advanced features such as artist collaborations. These advanced features can get arbitrary complex with the use of smart contracts.

## Design
We consider collection NFTs as tokens! The issued collection token will contain all the collection information.

An NFT will be considered as part of an already created collection if it follows the [artwork standard]() and the collection NFT is present in the first input of the issuance transaction which is known as the royalty box.

There is no limitation on the number of issued tokens for a collection. One possible interpretation of such a feature is that artists can come together and create a collection. Each one of them will have one collection token which gives the right to them to add NFTs to that collection. We believe that with the use of smart contracts, more advanced usage of this flexibility will be discovered in the future.

## NFT Collection Standard
One of the main goals of this proposal is for the standard to be as future-proof as possible. To achieve that, some of the features we introduce here may not contain an extensive explanation of how to use them. This enables NFT developers to participate in the EIP and also plan for their tools. However, it comes with the downside that this EIP will be prone to backward-compatible extensions in the future.

### Collection standard version
Collection standard version must be present in `R4` as `Int`. This current standard version is `1`. This will enable future radical changes depending on the state of the NFT ecosystem.

### Collection Info
Collection info must be present in `R5` of the issuance box as `Coll[Byte]`.
The following JSON contains the structure of collection info.
```json
{
    "name": "NAME_OF_THE_COLLECTION",
    "description": "DESCRIPTION_OF_THE_COLLECTION",
    "logo": "URL_TO_COLLECTION_LOGO",
    "featured_image": "URL_TO_COLLECTION_FEATURED_IMAGE",
    "banner_image": "URL_TO_COLLECTION_BANNER_IMAGE",
    "category": "COLLECTION_CATEGORY",
    "explicit_content": true or false
}
```

### Socials
Socials must be present in `R6` of the issuance box as `Coll[Byte]`.
The following JSON contains information about the socials of the collection and/or the artist(s).
```json
{
    "twitter": "TWITTER_PROFILE",
    "instagram": "INSTAGRAM_RPOFILE"
    ...
}
```

## Traits
Traits information must be present in `R7` of the issuance box as `Coll[Byte]`.
There are three types of traits:
- Properties: These are textual traits such as specifying `sex` as `male`.
- Levels: These are numerical traits that encode some sort of level-like information such as specifying `speed` as `60 out of 100`.
- Stats: These are numerical traits that encode any numerical information about the NFT such as specifying `age` as `25 out of 50`.

Although levels and stats are very similar, they can be considered different in marketplaces both for UI/UX purposes and also for filtering purposes.

The following specifies the structure for traits.
```json
{
    "properties": ["NAME_OF_PROPERTY1", "NAME_OF_PROPERTY2"],
    "levels": [
        {
            "NAME_OF_LEVEL1": max_alowed_level_number1
        },
        {
            "NAME_OF_LEVEL2": max_alowed_level_number2
        }
    ],
    "stats": [
        {
            "NAME_OF_STAT1": max_alowed_stat_number1
        },
        {
            "NAME_OF_STAT2": max_alowed_stat_number2
        },
        {
            "NAME_OF_STAT3": max_alowed_stat_number3
        }
    ]
}
```

The following is an example of traits for some imaginary NFT.
```json
{
    "properties": ["sex", "hair color", "eye color"],
    "levels": [
        {
            "power": 100 # this means the maximum possible power is 100
        },
        {
            "speed": 180 # this means the maximum possible power is 180
        }
    ],
    "stats": [
        {
            "rank": 50 # this means the maximum possible rank is 50
        }
        {
            "number of swords": 1000 # this means the maximum possible number of swords is 1000
        }
    ]
}
```
It must be noted that the actual value for traits will be present in the NFT data (refer to [artwork standard]()) and the above numbers for levels and stats only specify the maximum range.

## Unlockable Content
Unlockable content information must be present in `R8` of the issuance box as `Coll[Byte]`.
Unlockable contents are files or other types of information that the artist reveals to the buyer when NFT is sold (and/or some other conditions are satisfied). At the time of proposing this EIP, there are no known decentralized solutions to have unlockable contents. However, it is more than likely that we'll have solutions for this soon so this part of this EIP introduces a structure that can be changed for backward and forward compatibility in the future.
The following JSON contains the structure for unlockable contents.

```json
{
    "version" standard_version, # this will change as new standards are needed to be added for unlockable contents
    "type": "UNLOCKABLE_CONTENT_TYPE", # this will contain the type of unlockable content such as image
    "content": "CONTENT" # this will include the content to be unlocked in a way such that it is not revealed until some conditions are met -- this can be a URL or some other thing depending on "type"
}
```
